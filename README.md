# ThreadingAnts

Multithreading ants are eating cakes. This is so scary and threatening; however, the Makefile is available, so you may use it. 

If you want to execute the code, please run 

``` 
make 
``` 

and check that things are okay. In this sense, there is a set of attributes of the simulation that could be modified; verify, for instance, the preamble at [`main.cpp`](./main.cpp) for details and their names.
