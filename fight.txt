the ant should choose to fight or to eat. this is what we
have:

+ we are notified whether the ant contains food or there i
s a food with positive volume near, and also if it has foo
d; so, we have the information about the positiveness of t
he volume of the near food objects
+ if the volume is positive and the ant does not have food
, it should fight with probability one; if the volume is n
onpositive, it should flee with probability one
+ then, instead of moving randomly -- which happens if ther is no food with positive volume near --, it chooses (randomly) whether to fight or to (randomly) move
